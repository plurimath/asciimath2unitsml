Convert Units expressions via MathML to UnitsML

This gem converts 
MathML incorporating UnitsML expressions (based on the Ascii representation provided by NIST)
into MathML complying with https://www.w3.org/TR/mathml-units/[], with
UnitsML markup embedded in it, and with unique identifiers for each distinct unit, prefix, and dimension. 
Dimensions are automatically inserted corresponding to each unit.
Units expressions are identified in MathML as `<mtext>unitsml(...)</mtext>`, which in turn
can be identified in AsciiMath  as `"unitsml(...)"`. 

The consuming document is meant to deduplicate the instances of UnitsML markup
with the same identifier, and potentially remove them to elsewhere in the document
or another document.

The conventions used for writing units are:

* `^` for exponents, e.g. `m^-2`
* `*` to combine two units by multiplication; e.g. `m*s^-2`. 
* `/` to combine two units by division;
* `u` for Î¼ (micro-)

The gem follows the MathML Units convention of inserting a spacing invisible times operator
(`<mo rspace='thickmathspace'>&#x2062;</mo>`) between any numbers (`<mn>`) and unit expressions
in MathML, and representing units in MathML as non-italic variables (`<mi mathvariant='normal'>`).

== Usage

The converter is run as:

[source,ruby]
----
c = Asciimath2UnitsML::Conv.new()
c.Asciimath2UnitsML(1 "unitsml(mm*s^-2)") # AsciiMath string containing UnitsML
c.MathML2UnitsML("<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mn>7</mn>"\
  "<mtext>unitsml(kg^-2)</mtext></math>") # AsciiMath string containing <mtext>unitsml()</mtext>
c.MathML2UnitsML(Nokogiri::XML("<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mn>7</mn>"\
  "<mtext>unitsml(kg^-2)</mtext></math>")) # Nokogiri parse of MathML document containing <mtext>unitsml()</mtext>
----

The converter class may be initialised with options:

* `multiplier` is the symbol used to represent the multiplication of units. By default,
following MathML Units, the symbol is middle dot (`&#xB7`). An arbitrary UTF-8 string can be
supplied instead; it will be encoded as XML entities. The value `:space` is rendered
as a spacing invisible times in MathML (`<mo rspace='thickmathspace'>&#x2062;</mo>`),
and as a non-breaking space in HTML. The value `:nospace` is rendered as a non-spacing
invisible times in MathML (`<mo>&#x2062;</mo>`), and is not rendered in HTML.

== Units Notation

The units used in `unitsml()` are taken from the UnitsDB database as updated by Ribose:
https://github.com/unitsml/unitsdb[]. Units are given as an ASCII based code, consisting of
multiplication or division of single units, each of which is defined as a Prefix 
(taken from https://github.com/unitsml/unitsdb/blob/master/prefixes.yaml[]),
unit (taken from https://github.com/unitsml/unitsdb/blob/master/units.yaml[]),
and exponent; e.g. `mm*s^-2`. 

In case of ambiguity, the interpretation with no prefix is prioritised over the interpretation
as a unit; so `ct` is interpreted as _hundredweight_, rather than _centi-ton_. Exceptionally,
`kg` is decomposed into kilo-gram rather than treated as a basic unit, for consistency with
other prefixes of grams. (Prefixed units appear in UnitsDB, and are indicated as `prefixed: true`.)

A unit may have multiple symbols; these are registered separately in 
https://github.com/unitsml/unitsdb/units.yaml[units.yaml], as entries under `unit_symbols`.
These different symbols will be recognised as the same Unit in the UnitsML markup, but
the original symbol will be retained in the MathML expression. So an expression like `1 unitsml(mL)`
will be recognised as referring to microlitres; the expression will be given under its canonical
rendering `ml` in UnitsML markup, but the MathML rendering referencing that UnitsML expression
will keep the notation `mL`.

The symbols used for units can be highly ambiguous; in order to guarantee accurate parsing,
the symbols used to data enter units are unambiguous in https://github.com/unitsml/unitsdb/units.yaml[units.yaml].
They may be found as the entries for `unit_symbols/id` under each unit. For example, `B` is ambiguous between
_bel_ (as in decibel) and _byte_; they are kept unambiguous by using `bel_B` and `byte_B` to refer to them,
although they will still both be rendered as `B`.

The following table is the current list of ambiguous symbols, which are disambiguated in the symbol ids used.
This table can be generated (in Asciidoc format) through `Asciimath2UnitsML::Conv.new().ambig_units`:
